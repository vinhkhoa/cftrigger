		APPLICATION SPECIFIC SETTINGS
		
		You can put your own application configuration here.
		Make sure you put only application scope variables here because this file is loaded only
		once inside the OnApplicationStart() method. Request, session and other scopes variables
		are put inside the variables.cfm file sitting in the same folder as this file
